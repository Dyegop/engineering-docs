------ BASICS ------

A record in MongoDB is a document, which is a data structure composed of field and value pairs.
MongoDB stores documents in collections which are analogous to tables in relational databases.
Official documentation: https://www.mongodb.com/docs/manual/

Views (MongoDB v3.4+)
    -A view is a read-only queryable object whose contents are defined by an aggregation pipeline on other
    collections or views.

Aggregation Pipelines
	-An aggregation pipeline consists of one or more stages that process documents.
	-Each stage performs an operation on the input documents. For example, a stage can filter documents,
	group documents, and calculate values.
	-The documents that are output from a stage are passed to the next stage.
	-An aggregation pipeline can return results for groups of documents. For example, return the total, average,
	maximum, and minimum values.




------ QUERIES ------

Find documents with array_lenght > n
{$expr:{$gt:[{$size:"$array"}, n]}}

Find multiples elements
{key : {"$in" : [value1, value2, ...]}}
			
Find documents with array values matching conditions
{"array_name": {$elemMatch: {"value1": "foo", "value2": "bar", ...}}}

Find documents where field exists
{field: {$exists: <boolean>}}
